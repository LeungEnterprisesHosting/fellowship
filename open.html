Although some educational officials believe that a closed campus is superior, an
open campus reaps many benefits. Ultimately, an open campus in high school gives
students the freedom to make choices and gives students a greater control over
their environment. According to one study, giving students more autonomy improves
engagement and enthusiasm in class. One principal who has adopted the programs
into his high school believes that most of the students “are responsible and are
doing the right things" and that it helps “transition students into adulthood."
Another principal said that 95 percent of students use the privilege responsibly. </p><h2>Benefits</h2><p>Open education promotes:</p><ul><li>More individualized instruction</li><li>Opportunities for independent study</li><li>Students' acceptance of responsibility for their own educational development</li></ul><p>Open campus plans are also a way for high schools to:</p><ul><li>Develop a workable alternative to traditional high school programs</li><li>Break down the artificial barriers between the school and the community.</li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-5"><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0PnuLua.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></div></div></div><br><br></main><footer><nav class="navbar-inverse"><div class="container-fluid"><div class="footer-content"><p class="text-center">&copy; 2016 AA x SK x NL | <a href="cited">Works Cited &raquo;</a></p></div></div></nav></footer><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.min.js"></script><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
